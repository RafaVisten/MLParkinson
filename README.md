Backup of scientific initiation on applying machine learning methods to aid in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, which ran from 2024 .2 to 2025.2 and yielded two publications on the 2024 and 2025 ERI-GO (Escola Regional de Informática de Goiás) annals.

## Database

All notebooks contained in this repository have made use of the [PADS - Parkinson's disease smartwatch dataset](https://physionet.org/content/parkinsons-disease-smartwatch/1.0.0/). 

## Publications

2. [Identificação da Doença de Parkinson através da Análise de Dados Coletados por Smartwatch - Anais da Escola Regional de Informática de Goiás (ERI-GO) 2025](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/erigo/article/view/39520)

## Files

**HarmonicFeatures.ipynb** consists of the experiments with harmonic features as input for machine learning based classification tasks. Some of the included results were used as the basis for publication #2.

**PADS Experiments 1.ipynb** and **PADS Experiments 2.ipynb** both consist of experiments with statistical features.
